# Snake Game

The Snake game is a classic video game where the player controls a snake that moves across a screen and grows by eating food. The objective of the game is to make the snake as long as possible without hitting the walls or running into its own tail. The controls are just arrow keys to control the direction of the snake, making it easy to learn but difficult to master. It has been popular since the 1970s and is still enjoyed by players today.

But today, we're going to make the snake game in Python, for you to enjoy with your friends and family!
